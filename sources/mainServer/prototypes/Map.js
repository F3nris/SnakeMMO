/**
 * This prototype represents the map. There will always be only one map at the
 * time (atleast this is the current idea). The map holds a list of all active
 * chunks and their ids, so that it can be used to look up the segment manager
 * that has the information you are interested in. It also knows the current
 * size of the map.
 * It is also responsible for saving the state of "full- or emptyness" the map is
 * in. This value will be used to determine whether the map's size should be in-
 * creased or decreased (or kept).
